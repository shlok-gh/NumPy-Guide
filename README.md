# Why make a guide for something that is already available in some documentations/blogs online??

This guide was made by me when I had just started off with my coding tech world journey. I had a hard time finding good resources which explained every aspect (atleast which I was interested in) which was going to be useful for me in applying in real codes. 
Thus I decided to make a guide which starts off from zero, and also serves as reference notes for future usage and revision.
